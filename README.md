# Vulp â€“ Robot/simulation switch

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> Vulp has been merged into the [Upkie wheeled biped software](https://github.com/upkie/upkie) and is not developed as a standalone library any more. If you need similar features for your own robot, we recommend you rather start from the latest [moteus](https://pypi.org/project/moteus/) C++ bindings.

Vulp provides an action-observation loop to control robots from a standalone "agent" process, like this:

</p>

Vulp is designed for robots built with the mjbots stack ([moteus](https://github.com/mjbots/moteus/) servo controllers and [pi3hat](https://github.com/mjbots/pi3hat/) communication board). It provides a robot/simulation switch to train or test agents in [Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) before running them on the real system. Vulp supports Linux and macOS for development, and Raspberry Pi OS for robot deployment.

## Why the name "Vulp"?

[Vulp](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vulp#Noun_2) means "fox" in Romansh, a language spoken in the Swiss canton of the Grisons. Foxes are arguably quite reliable in their reaction times ðŸ¦Š

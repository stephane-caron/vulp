Vulp provides an action-observation loop to control robots from a standalone "agent" process, like this:

</p>

The agent can be a simple Python script with few dependencies.

Vulp is designed for robots built with the mjbots stack ([moteus](https://github.com/mjbots/moteus/) servo controllers and [pi3hat](https://github.com/mjbots/pi3hat/) communication board). It provides a robot/simulation switch to train or test agents in [Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) before running them on the real system.

Vulp supports Linux and macOS for development, and Raspberry Pi OS for robot deployment.

## Example

Check out the [``upkie``](https://github.com/upkie/upkie) repository for an example where Vulp is used to implement simulation environments, real-robot spines, state observers and locomotion agents.

## Q and A

### Performance

#### I just started a simulation spine but it's surprisingly slow, how come?

Make sure you switch Bazel's [compilation mode](https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference#flag--compilation_mode) to "opt" when running both robot experiments and simulations. The compilation mode is "fastbuild" by default. Note that it is totally fine to compile agents in "fastbuild" during development while testing them on a spine compiled in "opt" that keeps running in the background.

#### I have a Bullet simulation where the robot balances fine, but the agent repeatedly warns it "Skipped X clock cycles". What could be causing this?

This happens when your CPU is not powerful enough to run the simulator in real-time along with your agent and spine. You can call [`Spine::simulate`](https://upkie.github.io/vulp/classvulp_1_1spine_1_1Spine.html#a886ef5562b33f365d86e77465dd86204) with ``nb_substeps = 1`` instead of ``Spine::run``, which will result in the correct simulation time from the agent's point of view but make the simulation slower than real-time from your point of view.

#### I'm running a pi3hat spine, why are my timings more erratic than the ones plotted above?

Make sure you configure CPU isolation and set the scaling governor to ``performance`` for real-time performance on a Raspberry Pi.

### Design choices

#### Why use dictionaries rather than an [interface description language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) like Protocol Buffers?

Interface description languages like Protocol Buffers are strongly typed: they formally specify a data exchange format that has to be written down and maintained, but brings benefits like versioning or breaking-change detection. Vulp, on the other hand, follows a weakly-typed, self-describing approach that is better suited to prototyping with rapidly-changing APIs: the spec is in the code. If an agent and spine communicate with incompatible/incomplete actions/observations, execution will break, begging for developers to fix it.

#### Why the weakly-typed dictionary IPC rather than Pythonâ€“C++ bindings?

Vulp is designed for prototyping: it strives to eliminate intermediaries when it can, and keep a low barrier of entry. Python bindings bring the benefits of typing and are a good choice in production contexts, but like interface description languages, they also add overhead in terms of developer training, bookkeeping code and compilation time. Vulp rather goes for a crash-early approach: fast changes, fast blunders (interface errors raise exceptions that end execution), fast fixes (know immediately when an error was introduced).

#### Is it possible to run two agents at the same time?

That is not possible. One of the core assumptions in Vulp is that the agent and the spine are two respective processes communicating via one single shared-memory area. In this Vulp differs from *e.g.* ROS, which is multi-process by design. This design choice is discussed in [#55](https://github.com/upkie/vulp/discussions/55).

#### Why the name "Vulp"?

[Vulp](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vulp#Noun_2) means "fox" in Romansh, a language spoken in the Swiss canton of the Grisons. Foxes are arguably quite reliable in their reaction times ðŸ¦Š

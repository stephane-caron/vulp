Vulp provides an action-observation loop to control robots from a standalone "agent" process, like this:

</p>

The agent can be a simple Python script with few dependencies.

Vulp is designed for robots built with the mjbots stack ([moteus](https://github.com/mjbots/moteus/) servo controllers and [pi3hat](https://github.com/mjbots/pi3hat/) communication board). It provides a robot/simulation switch to train or test agents in [Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) before running them on the real system.

Vulp supports Linux and macOS for development, and Raspberry Pi OS for robot deployment.

## Example

Check out the [``upkie``](https://github.com/upkie/upkie) repository for an example where Vulp is used to implement simulation environments, real-robot spines, state observers and locomotion agents.

## Q and A

#### Is it possible to run two agents at the same time?

That is not possible. One of the core assumptions in Vulp is that the agent and the spine are two respective processes communicating via one single shared-memory area. In this Vulp differs from *e.g.* ROS, which is multi-process by design. This design choice is discussed in [#55](https://github.com/upkie/vulp/discussions/55).

#### Why the name "Vulp"?

[Vulp](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vulp#Noun_2) means "fox" in Romansh, a language spoken in the Swiss canton of the Grisons. Foxes are arguably quite reliable in their reaction times ðŸ¦Š

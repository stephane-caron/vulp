# ðŸ‘· Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute to the project. Here are some ideas:

- Build a new robot using mjbots actuators and report your experience using Vulp on it
- Pick one of the [open issues](https://github.com/upkie/vulp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)
- Suggest improvements to the [documentation](https://upkie.github.io/vulp/)

Feel free to join the [chat](https://app.element.io/#/room/#tasts-robots:matrix.org) to share what you're up to with other makers.
